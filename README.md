GIT is an open source program for tracking changes in text files and is in the core technology that GitHub, the social and interface is built.

GITHUB is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system. GitHub offers both paid plans for private repositories, and free accounts for open source projects

Repository is the most basic element of GitHub. A repository contains all the project files and stores each file revision history

Clone: is a copy of a repository that lives on computer instead of on website server

Commit is an individual change to a file that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.

Push is sending your committed changes to a remote repository such as a repository hosted on GitHub 

Pull is when you are fetching in changes and merging them.

Branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes

Merge Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a pull request (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done automatically via a pull request via the GitHub web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line.

Merge Conflict usually occurs when your current branch and the branch you want to merge into the current branch have diverged. That is, you have commits in your current branch which are not in the other branch, and vice versa 

Fetch is getting the latest changes from an online repository without merging them in.

Remote is the version of something that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub. It can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced
